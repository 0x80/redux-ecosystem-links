### Side Effects - Functions

- **redux-thunk**  
  https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk  
  The simplest possible side effects approach: dispatch functions instead of objects, which then get access to `dispatch` and `getState`.  (Variations on the concept listed on the [Middleware](middleware.md) page.)
  
- **redux-action-side-effects**  
  https://github.com/jonnyreeves/redux-action-side-effects  
  Trigger side effects after actions have been reduced.
  
- **redux-thunk-effects**  
  https://github.com/shakacode/redux-thunk-effects  
  Thunk-like handling with additions.
  
- **redux-thunktions**  
  https://github.com/ohjames/redux-thunktions  
  An FSA compatible redux thunk middleware ideal for use with redux-actions and/or redux-promise-middleware.
  
- **redux-effects**  
  https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects  
  Virtual DOM for effects and impurities. You write pure functions, redux-effects handles the rest.
  
- **redux-async-action**  
  https://github.com/kevhuang/redux-async-action  
  Dispatches FSA actions for asynchronous Redux actions 
  
- **redux-thunk-status**  
  https://github.com/dieseljobs/redux-thunk-status  
  Simple redux async action status management 
  
- **redux-thunk-subscribe**  
  https://github.com/tinybike/redux-thunk-subscribe  
  Similar to Redux Thunk, but with subscribe available to thunks (in addition to dispatch and getState) so they can add listeners to the store on-the-fly.
  
- **redux-optimistic-thunk**  
  https://github.com/ecomfe/redux-optimistic-thunk  
  redux-optimistic-thunk is a redux-thunk like middleware with optimistic UI supported.
